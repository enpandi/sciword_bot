# word power bot

A Discord bot to help users practice for [Science Word](https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/Science_Word), although it could also be used for other similar purposes.

The mechanism is simple; when a user sends `word` into a channel, the bot replies to that user with a secret word from a word list, which only that user is intended to read. Then, that user can give hints to guessers.
